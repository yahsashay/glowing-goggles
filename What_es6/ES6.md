**What is ES6?**

ECMAScript* (or ES) is a JavaScript standard meant to ensure the interoperability of web pages across different web browsers.

ECMAScript is commonly used for [client-side scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_scripting) on the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web), and it is increasingly being used for writing server applications and services using [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js)
